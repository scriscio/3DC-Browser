Notes:

- Create a THREE.Curve object for the genome - should be simple enough... - DONE
- create a THREE.TubeGeometry - DONE
- build some way to rotate/zoom with the mouse - DONE
- loading the file/colors - loading file is DONE
- loading bedfiles
- Using a colormap with the TubeGeometry/mesh, because it looks more attractive than Line
